How it works
============

To be able to detect vulnerabilities, agents are able to natively collect a list of installed applications (:ref:`System inventory <syscollector>`), sending it periodically to the manager (where it is stored in local sqlite databases, one per agent). Also, the manager builds a global vulnerability database, from publicly available CVE repositories, using it later to cross-correlate this information with the agent's applications inventory data.

The global vulnerability database is created automatically, currently pulling data from the following repositories:

- `<https://canonical.com>`_: Used to pull CVEs for Ubuntu Linux distributions.
- `<https://www.redhat.com>`_: Used to pull CVEs for Red Hat and CentOS Linux distributions.
- `<https://www.debian.org>`_: Used to pull CVEs for Debian Linux distributions.
- `<https://nvd.nist.gov/>`_: Used to pull CVEs from the National Vulnerability Database.
- `<https://feed.wazuh.com/>`_: Used to pull the MSU feed with CVEs and patches for Microsoft products.

This database can be configured to be updated periodically, ensuring that the solution will check for the very latest CVEs.

Once the global vulnerability database (with the CVEs) is created, the detection process looks for vulnerable packages in the inventory databases (unique per agent). Alerts are generated when a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) affects a package that is known to be installed in one of the monitored hosts. A package is labeled as vulnerable when its version is contained within the affected range of a CVE.
The results are presented as alerts and also stored in a per-agent vulnerabilities inventory. So you can check the last scan alerts, or query every single agent's vulnerabilities inventory.

Scan types
^^^^^^^^^^

The Vulnerability Detector module run scans on startup (if :ref:`run_on_start <vuln_det_run_on_start>` is enabled) and every certain period of time (defined by :ref:`interval <vuln_det_interval>`).
In any of these cases, the packages and the operating system that were already scanned will not be re-scanned. Only new installed packages will be considered for the scans and alerts will be generated if they have vulnerabilities.
There is only one case in which the packages and the operating system will be re-scanned, when the database of vulnerabilities receives new CVEs information and :ref:`min_full_scan_interval <vuln_det_min_full_scan_interval>` expires.

We have then three different types of scan:

- `Baseline`: This scan type will be triggered the first time after `Vulnerability Detector` is enabled. It performs a full scan for every single package installed as well as the operating system. As a result, the CVEs inventory will have the information of the vulnerabilities detected but no alerts will be generated.
- `Full scan`: In this scan type, every single package installed as well as the operating system are scanned. It runs only when the configured :ref:`min_full_scan_interval <vuln_det_min_full_scan_interval>` expires and the CVEs database is updated with new information. As a result, the vulnerabilities update will be alerted.
- `Partial scan`: Only new packages are scanned. As a result, the vulnerabilities update will be alerted.

There are few considerations that arise from this behavior:

- The :ref:`min_full_scan_interval <vuln_det_min_full_scan_interval>` setting, will protect the manager performance from running too often `Full scans` in case of receiving many updates of vulnerabilities feeds.
- Every vulnerability in the agents vulnerabilities inventory for both, packages and operating system, may be found in three different status:
    - `VALID` state indicates that the vulnerability is still present in the system.
    - `PENDING` state is set when a feed update occurs and a new scan is needed to confirm whether or not the system is still vulnerable to this specific vulnerability.
    - `OBSOLETE` state indicates that the vulnerability is no longer present in the system. This state is then used to generate the removal alerts.

Alerts generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Detection alerts are generated when is detected that a new vulnerability is added to the vulnerabilities inventory.
- Removal alerts are generated when is detected that a vulnerability has been removed from the vulnerabilities inventory.

The following example diagram may be useful to understand the steps involved in a typical `vulnerability detector` workflow.
